# Cwtch of the Day

In his course "[React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/)", Wes Bos builds a web app called "[Catch of the Day](https://catchoftheday.wesbos.com/)". "Cwtch of the Day" is an attempt to recreate "Catch of the Day" using Phoenix Liveview; no front-end frameworks, no custom JavaScript, just plain vanilla Liveview.
